description: An introduction to Chord documentation
---

Welcome to the documentation for __`Chord`__, an open-source _TypeScript_ framework for building robust and scalable server-client applications.

__`Chord`__ provides type-safe remote procedure calls `RPC` on top of the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol. It uses a class-based approach and middleware support to compose server-side methods that can be securely accessed from the client.

This documentation site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to be fast, accessible and fully customizable. The navigation sidebar contains links to key guides and references for getting started, developing features, and configuring __Chord__ in your project.

#### Some <u>key features</u> enabled by __`Chord`__ include:

* Instant typesafety - Ensure typed method calls on both client and server with _TypeScript_.
* Enhanced productivity - Rich autocompletions in any IDE streamline development.
* Minimal overhead - Seamless access to server functions from client with minimal payload size.
* Flexible integration - Integrate __`Chord`__ into existing projects easily without conflicts.

We hope you find this documentation helpful in leveraging __`Chord`__'s capabilities. Please provide any feedback on how we can improve. [Let us know](https://t.me/din_dm) if you have any other questions!
